          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Gentrification is a subject that has received significant media and academic attention in the last few decades, mainly because it’s a process powered by the possibility of mobility which has been limited in earlier years. Given the recent rise of this phenomena, researchers have not yet been able to reach an agreement on what are its causes, its social and economical effects, or even on what constitutes a formal process of gentrification. Regardless of this, the subject is one that continues to gain importance, mainly because it has been accelerating on recent years, and it has significant implications in public policy; for example, in several studies it has been negatively associated with the displacement of population and loss of capital investment.</p>

          <p>An interesting study performed on this subject is that of <em>Nathalie Voorhees</em> from Chicago's Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement. On it, the researcher takes 13 variables that have been associated with gentrification and neighborhood upgrading in the literature and uses them to create a <em>Gentrification Index</em> that evaluates this process through Chicago's different community areas. More details can be found <a href="http://www.voorheescenter.com/#!gentrification-index/ccmx" target="_blank">here</a>. We will translate Voorhees' study to the New York Metro area, investigating the relevance of our results under this different social and economic context.</p>
